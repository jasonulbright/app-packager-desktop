# Definitions maintenance

Definition upkeep (vendor URLs, scraper patterns, silent switches) is
recurring maintenance, not development work. Scrapers rot on the
vendor's schedule, not ours.

## Cadence

- **Weekly:** scraper sweep — no downloads, no installs:

  ```
  dotnet run --project tools\TestHarness -c Release -- src\ApplicationPackagerEngine\Definitions C:\temp\packr-check --check-only
  ```

  Produces `definition-check-<timestamp>.csv` (App, Result, Version,
  Error). Investigate every FAIL: usually a vendor page change; fix the
  scraper config in the definition, never the frozen test verdicts.

- **Monthly (or after any definition edit):** full harness pass for the
  changed apps only (`--app <name>`), install + detect + uninstall on
  the lab client, verdict recorded in REGRESSION-STATUS.md.

- **Signed-off definitions stay frozen** (REGRESSION-STATUS.md rule):
  a scraper fix that does not change install behavior does not reopen
  the app's verdict; anything touching InstallArgs, Detection, or the
  payload does.

## Piggybacking on app-packager

The PowerShell sibling (C:\projects\app-packager) checks the same
vendors from its own packagers. Its scheduled runs (run with /netonly
credentials against the site) double as early warning: a vendor change
that breaks a PS packager will usually break the matching Packr
definition the same week. When a PS packager gains a fixed URL or
pattern, port the fix to the matching definition here in the same
sitting.
